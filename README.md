# Room_reservation--Django

The Room Reservation System is a complete solution for displaying information and the occupancy status of rooms. It is a simple and intuitive tool for effective management of office space resources.

In the project, I did not focus on the aspect of the visual layer because the back end was the most important to me.
It is a simple application based on the Django framework and a simple database.
